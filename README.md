# Bus-Management System

Bus management system is a web application for managing the bus, its driver, owner and users data. It is
an object oriented programming project using which a user can book bus tickets choosing the seat of
his/her choice. Users can search buses between routes, know the arriving and departure times and route of
the bus. Using this system bus conductors can check the ticket validation of the passangers. Admin can
manage the entire system from editing the data to adding new data. This project is completely made in
java language. Java servlets are used to make the application run on web servers. With the concept of
containers and servlets this system can handle multiple requests at the same time. Anyone can access this
system from anywhere. Few java libraries are used in this project such as sql library to make the database
connectivity.
